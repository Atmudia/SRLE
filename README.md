# **SRLE** 

Slime Rancher 2 Level Editor (SRLE2) is a mod/tool that gives overall creating levels for either the fun of it or your mods!

## **Key Features:**

### **Level Editing**

<p> This is an obvious of course but the goal is to make it a comfortable experience so you aren't uncomfortable with what you're making, this could be the UI for example or things to overall make it a better experience such as Gizmos. I know you may or may not know what this is but it's useful. </p>

### **Modding**

A key feature of SRLE is the modding support. You can build something then export it! Could BB do that? I don't think so. After the extraction you can easily import it into your mod.. that'll probably be explained later but you can. If you weren't doing this you'd instead manually add each part of the thing you're building which would take much longer and probably much messier. It's not bad to take a shortcut all the time.

### **Presets**

Another nice feature of this is that you can start off with some kind of preset. For now we have:

**Empty (Void)** <br>
**Normal** <br>
**Sea (Slime Sea)** <br>

<p> So you can build from scratch even with the void! Could be great for building a new zone.

And there is much, much, much, much, much *okay maybe not that much* more to discover! It may just be your new favorite level editor.
